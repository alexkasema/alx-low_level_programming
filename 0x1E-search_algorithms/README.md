# C - Search Algorithms
A search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.
Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms:
* Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.
*  Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order.
* Hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.
## 0-linear.c
A  function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.
## 1-binary.c
A function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.
## 2-O     O(n)
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?
## 3-O     O(1)
What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?
## 4-O     O(log(n))
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
